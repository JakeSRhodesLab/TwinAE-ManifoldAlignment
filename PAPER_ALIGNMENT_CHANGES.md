## ðŸŽ¯ Key Paper Concepts Integrated

### **Primary Innovation: Out-of-Sample Extension**
The repository now clearly presents the main contribution as solving the out-of-sample extension problem for manifold alignment methods, which traditionally require recomputation for new data points.

### **Twin Autoencoder Architecture**
- Two independent autoencoders (AE_X, AE_Y) with encoder-decoder pairs
- Three-component loss function with reconstruction, alignment, and anchor terms
- Cross-domain translation via decoder swapping mechanism

### **Clinical Validation**
- ADNI dataset with ADAS-Cog 13 and FAQ assessments
- Translation accuracy: RMSE 1.12-1.48 across ~1,200 patients
- Practical application: predicting care requirements from cognitive tests

### **Comprehensive Evaluation**
- Mantel correlation analysis (0.17-0.80 across methods)
- Cross-domain mapping superiority over MAGAN, DTA, MASH
- Downstream task performance improvements

## ðŸ“Š Technical Alignment

### **Loss Functions**
Updated to match paper notation:
```
â„’ = â„’_recon + Î»â„’_align + â„’_anchor

where:
- â„’_recon = (1/n_x) Î£ ||x_i - g_X(f_X(x_i))||Â²
- â„’_align = (1/n_x) Î£ ||f_X(x_k) - e_{x_k}||Â²  
- â„’_anchor = (1/n_A) Î£ ||f_X(x_j) - e_{a_{x_j}}||Â²
```

### **Method Descriptions**
Corrected baseline method descriptions to match paper:
- **DTA**: Diffusion Transport Alignment (not Domain Transfer Analysis)
- **JLMA**: Joint Laplacian Manifold Alignment
- **MAPA**: Manifold Alignment via Procrustes Analysis
- **MASH**: Manifold Alignment via Stochastic Hopping
- **SPUD**: Shortest Paths on Union of Domains
- **MAGAN**: Manifold Alignment GAN

## âœ… Repository Status

The repository now accurately reflects the accepted MMAI 2025 paper with:
- âœ… Correct paper title and author information
