# Guided Manifold Alignment with Geometry-Regularized Twin Autoencoders

**Accepted at MMAI 2025 Workshop @ IEEE ICDM 2025**

## Abstract

This work presents a novel approach to guided manifold alignment using Geometry-Regularized Twin Autoencoders (GRAE). Our method addresses the fundamental challenge of aligning heterogeneous data modalities by learning shared geometric representations while preserving the intrinsic structure of each domain.

## Key Contributions

### 1. **Geometry-Regularized Autoencoders (GRAE)**
- Novel autoencoder architecture that enforces geometric consistency between input and latent spaces
- Preserves local neighborhood relationships during dimensionality reduction
- Combines reconstruction loss with geometric regularization for stable manifold learning

### 2. **Anchor Guidance Framework**
- Incorporates known correspondence constraints (anchor points) into the learning process
- Significantly improves alignment quality when partial correspondence information is available
- Balances between geometric regularization and intelligent anchor-guided learning

### 3. **Twin Architecture**
- Paired autoencoders for bidirectional domain translation (A↔B)
- Cycle consistency loss ensures stable and symmetric alignment
- Handles domain asymmetries and varying dimensionalities effectively

### 4. **Multimodal Applications**
- Demonstrated effectiveness on neuroimaging data (ADNI dataset)
- Supports various data modalities: tabular, images, time series
- Scalable to high-dimensional multimodal datasets

## Technical Innovation

### Loss Function Design
The GRAE loss combines three key components:

1. **Reconstruction Loss**: Standard autoencoder reconstruction error
2. **Geometric Regularization**: Preserves manifold structure in latent space
3. **Anchor Loss** (GRAEAnchor): Enforces known correspondences

```
L_total = L_reconstruction + λ_geo * L_geometric + λ_anchor * L_anchor
```

### Architecture Benefits
- **Flexibility**: Adapts to different data types automatically (MLP for tabular, CNN for images)
- **Robustness**: Stable training with geometric constraints
- **Interpretability**: Latent space preserves meaningful geometric relationships
- **Scalability**: Efficient GPU-accelerated training for large datasets
