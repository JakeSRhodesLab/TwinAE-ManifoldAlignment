# Requirements.txt Analysis for Demonstration Notebooks

## Packages Found in Demonstration Notebooks

### âœ… Already in requirements.txt:
- `graphtools==1.5.3` - Used for graph construction and analysis
- `POT==0.9.4` - Python Optimal Transport library (imported as 'ot')
- `scprep==1.2.3` - Data preprocessing for single-cell analysis
- `phate==1.0.11` - PHATE dimensionality reduction
- `scikit-learn==1.5.1` - Machine learning library (imported as 'sklearn')
- `scipy==1.11.4` - Scientific computing
- `numpy==1.25.2` - Numerical computing
- `matplotlib==3.8.4` - Plotting library
- `seaborn==0.13.2` - Statistical data visualization
- `pandas==2.0.3` - Data manipulation and analysis

### âœ… Added packages:
- `mashspud @ git+https://github.com/rustadadam/mashspud.git` - MASH and SPUD methods for manifold alignment
  - Status: Added as Git dependency from official repository
  - Provides MASH and SPUD classes used in demonstration notebooks

### ðŸ“‹ Internal modules (not external packages):
- `test_manifold_algorithms` - Internal utility module (needs to be moved to helpers)
- `temporal_progression_comparisons` - Internal analysis module (needs to be moved)
- `MASH`, `SPUD` (from local files) - Internal alignment methods
- `AutoEncoders`, `GRAEAnchor` - Internal autoencoder implementations

## Summary

The requirements.txt file now contains all the essential external dependencies needed for the demonstration notebooks, including the `mashspud` package installed directly from the official GitHub repository.

The main issues preventing the notebooks from running are:
1. Internal import path fixes needed in alignment method files
2. Some internal modules need to be moved to the proper package structure
3. The package installation issues identified in the import verification

## Recommendations

1. âœ… Requirements.txt is comprehensive for external dependencies
2. ðŸ”§ Focus on fixing internal import paths in alignment method files
3. ðŸ“¦ Move internal modules to proper package locations
4. ðŸ§ª Test notebook functionality after package import fixes are completed
